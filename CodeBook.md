## Introduction

This document describes the variables included in the tidy data set
that is generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.

All variables (except `Activity.ID`, `Activity.Label` and `Subject.ID`)
where generated by aggregating all data through the `mean` function, and
grouping it by activity (i.e. `Activity.Label`) and subject (i.e. 
`Subject.ID`).
